        <p>Hello! My name is Jennifer and I currently live in Los Angeles, California. I am so excited to see how far I will go in this course. Obviously this page is at a bare-minimum but I'm looking forward to growing and expanding my portfolio. In my free time I love to cook and hangout with my boyfriend and cats. I wish I could travel more right now but hopefully soon I'll be able to go on new adventure. 

            My goals for my furture are to become a pro web-developer and continue my work and education in this feild. I hope to work my way to the top of a buisness and manage a team.
